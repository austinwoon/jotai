title: Initialising Atom State on Demand with Providers
nav: 5.04

There are times when you need to create an reusable component whose initial state has to be created on demand.

Below is a basic example of illustrating how you can use `Provider` and its prop, `initialValues`, to achieve this.

### Basic Example

> CodeSandbox link for your reference: [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/strange-tdd-gb1eo0?file=/src/App.js).

Consider a basic example where you have a reusable `TextDisplay` component that allows you to display and update plain text.

This component has two child components, `PrettyText` and `UpdateTextInput`.

- `PrettyText` is displays the text in blue.
- `UpdateTextInput` is an input field which updates the text value.

As opposed to passing `text` as a prop in the two child components, you decided that the `text` state should be shared between components as an atom.

To make `TextDisplay` component reusable, it must take in a prop, `initialTextValue`, which determines the initial state of the `text` atom.

To achieve this, we do so by wrapping the child components in a `Provider`. Then, we populate the `initialValues` array of atom tuples with the initial values.

```jsx
const textAtom = atom('')

const PrettyText = () => {
  const [text] = useAtom(textAtom)
  return (
    <>
      <text
        style={{
          color: 'blue',
        }}>
        {text}
      </text>
    </>
  )
}

const UpdateTextInput = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useAtom(textAtom)
  const handleInputChange = (e) => {
    setText(e.target.value)
  }
  return (
    <>
      <input onChange={handleInputChange} value={text} />
    </>
  )
}

export const TextDisplay = ({ initialTextValue }) => {
  return (
    // initialising on demand here
    <Provider initialValues={[[textAtom, initialTextValue]]}>
      <PrettyText />
      <br />
      <UpdateTextInput />
    </Provider>
  )
}
```

Now, we can easily resue `TextDisplay` component with different initial text values despite them referencing the "same" atom.

This is due to our child components looking for the lowest commmon ancestor `Provider` to derive its value.

For more information on `Provider`, please read the `Provider` docs [here](https://jotai.org/docs/api/core#provider).
